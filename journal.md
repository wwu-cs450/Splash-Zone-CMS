### Tasks Attempted
1. We set up the repo and we set up a couple files such as our Readme markdown file which is going to be our documentation file where we put all the necessary documentation
2. We set up an MIT license so it can be known that anyone can use it free of charge. 
3. We talked about what the customer needs and the path to solve that problem to give the customer a better means of handling their business and we talked about what we wanted the project to look like at the end of the quarter

### Notes & Reflections
Some reflections that I have for the course of this project is to have good workplace practices and make sure we are in constant communication of where we are in the project to make sure that we are on track to finish and so we do not step on each other toes when working on different features and such.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Read up on the documentation for react and google firebase as these will be the software that we want to use this quarter to do this project.
- [ ] We want to use figma to kind of get an idea of what we want our project to look like and have a protoype.
