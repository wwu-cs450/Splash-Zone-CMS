# Wash-Zone-CMS
This project entails the development of a customer management system for The Wash Zone car wash, located on 1907 E Isaac Ave in Walla Walla Washington. The customer is the owner and manager of the company, Susan Brookins, who will critique development and define the features for this project. The development team will include Zachary Kim, Josh Bielas, Andrew Gutierrez, and Careney Mchau. Our technical mentor will be Dr. Preston Carman, who will guide our development to adhere to production quality software standards. 

This project will replace the car wash’s current pencil and paper customer record system in favor of a digital one: The Wash Zone operates on a subscription-based model, with each subscriber holding a sticker with a letter followed by three numbers; each ID maps to the information of the subscription holder. The employee must enter the office and verify each vehicle. Due to the unique nature of the current customer lookup flow, there are no known alternatives able to replace the physical system; finally, the budget for the application is slim to none. It is with these constraints in mind that our team looks to tailor a custom application to streamline the company’s workflow.
