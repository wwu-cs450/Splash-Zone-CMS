# Firebase Setup

This doc describes the pocess to get local firebase tools for development specifically the emulator.

## Prerequisites

### Java 21

You will need java jdk-21 or greater (yes 25 will work) to run firebase.

[Install java development kit 21](https://https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)

To verify the installation run:

```bash
java --version
```

### npm and nodejs

You will need nodejs between version 20 and 22. Which can be found on the [nodejs website.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) I believe npm is packaged with nodejs.

To verify the installation run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Firebase firetime setup

Before running the init you will need add a .env file in the cms-app containting the actaul values of the following:

cms-app/.env

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "Your Key",
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = "Your Domain",
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "Your ProjectID",
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = "Your Bucket" ,
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = "Your Sender ID",
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID = "Your APP ID",
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID = "Your Measurement ID"
```

Because firebase charges based on read/write it is nessesary to use the firebase emulator for both the authentication and storage.
These are the bash commands you will need to run to initialize the project. Open a terminal in the root of the project and run:

```bash
cd cms-app
npm install

# This will take you to a new page to login with firebase
firebase login
firebase init
```

After "firebase init" is run an option box will appear. Use spacebar to select options and enter to confirm. Most things will be left as default execpt a few options

- For Features:
  - Firestone
  - Emulators
- For project setup:
  - use existing project and then choose Washzone-cms.
- for firestone setup
  - location: us-west1
  - everything else should be default
- for emulator setup
  - Authentication Emulator select:
    - FireStone
    - Emulator
  - Leave everything else as default or Y.

To start the emulator simply run:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

make sure you are in the cms-app director when you run this.
